<PRE>Martin, 

you are more than welcome!
I updated the documentation
<A HREF="http://www.manticore-projects.com/content/de/documentation.htm">http://www.manticore-projects.com/content/de/documentation.htm</A> in order
to reflect the new features. Will translate it into English as soon as
possible.

&gt;<i> 1. Are the stop loss and take profit thresholds calculated and initiated
</I>&gt;<i> from the underlying or from the Zertifikat itself? Because if its the
</I>&gt;<i> Zertifikat itself, one has to take the spread into consideration, which, at
</I>&gt;<i> leverage 10 for example, makes up for 0,16% already. Imagine, you have a
</I>&gt;<i> stop loss of 0,2% in place, then the spread alone already takes up most of
</I>&gt;<i> it. Or is the underlying the measurement?
</I>
At the moment the mechanism is simple: the threshold is related to the
highest price of the warrant since the position was opened. On Thursday
I recognized already this might not be accurate as it ignores the
leverage of the warrant. I think we have to multiply the trailing stop
loss ratio with the leverage of the warrant. In any way the spread is
recognized already.

In general I feel the solution of using threshold is just a temporary
quick fix.I would like to prefer a solution when the last resistance of
the underyling is used to adjust the stop-loss. But this gives a messy
dependency to the chart module which I would like to avoid.


&gt;<i> 2. In what running state does the program need to be kept in order to able
</I>&gt;<i> to stop losses and take profits automatically? Does the order form need to
</I>&gt;<i> be kept open? Does the program automatically reconnect and takes up work
</I>&gt;<i> again, when internet connection is lost temporarily?
</I>
The auto TP and the trailing stop loss is just a kind of emulation. The
program receive new quotes and adjusts the existing orders accordingly.
This means, the manticore-trader needs to run in order to adjust the
orders. The execution of the order is independent from the
manticore-trader.

In case the connection gets lost, it really depends on the
circumstances. Most times everything continues after short breakage.
Sometimes the push quote stream hangs. Then you need to push the refresh
button.
In the worst case just restart the program. The open positions are
stored and will be updated as soon as you start the manticore-trader.

Please note: you stop-loss is always safe, as its execution does not
depend on manticore-trader. So the worst case is the stop loss is not
adjusted while your position is in the profit already and finally the
original stop loss is executed when the price goes down.

&gt;<i> 3. When the automatic take profit option is activated and the take profit
</I>&gt;<i> threshold is actually reached, but the selling order does not go through -
</I>&gt;<i> does the program automatically reinstate the stop loss order again after a
</I>&gt;<i> while?
</I>
I often go for a walk outside with open positions and I often have power
line or internet breakage -- so I programmed everything as safe as
possible. In fact, auto take profit does not issue a sale-order, but
adjust the existing SL-order to the target. Either the broker accepts
the order or the original SL-order still exists otherwise. This way your
position is never in a state of not being secured by a SL.

Also you can push &quot;set SL to entry&quot; twice: the first time (when SL is
less than entry) SL is adjusted onto entry, the second time (when SL &gt;=
entry) SL is set to last market price. This way you can limit the risk
to the original target but still maintain a small chance of even more
profit.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much for this awesome program!
</I>&gt;<i> Martin
</I>
With your kind feedback we can improve it even more. Please do not
hesitate to contact me in case of any issue! Best regards

Andreas
