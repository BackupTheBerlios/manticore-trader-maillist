Subject: [Manticore-trader] manticore-trader 0.9.9.3 released
Message-ID: <1275392623.2977.290.camel@dhcppc0>

Dear All,

beside some small, but important fixes, manticore-trader adopts the new
website of Deutsche Bank. So you can search for WaveXLL again.

I plan to move the website parser settings into a single file stored on
the web server where manticore-trader downloads it automatically from in
order to keep you up to date.

Also I started some drafts to support more instruments like shares,
plain vanilla warrants, discount and bonus warrant. These features will
go into the development branch, as soon as version 1.0 is released next
week.

Best regards
Andreas

Subject: [Manticore-trader] Stable release manticore-trader 1.0
Message-ID: <1275649151.2977.352.camel@dhcppc0>

Dear All,

We proudly present the stable release 1.0 of manticore-trader, which is
ready for daily use and heavy trading activities.

While we will maintain this stable release we will focus our development
on the development branch now. Expect many exciting new features like
trading of shares, plain vanilla and discount/bonus warrants. Please
take a look into our to-do list and do not forget to write down your
requests. 

For this release we moved all parsing related information into a new
configuration file, which is stored on the webserver. The program ill
fetch any necessary update automatically now in order to decrease update
cycle. New new code of WebsiteParser class is very clean and beautiful.

Also the was a heavy test of the DIRECT orders (I spent almost 20
transactions on it!), which should work without any problem now.

Cheers!
Andreas
