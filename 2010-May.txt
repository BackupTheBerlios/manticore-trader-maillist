Subject: [Manticore-trader] manticore-trader version 0.9.9 released
Message-ID: <1274267672.3107.3.camel@dhcppc0>

Dear All!

This new version introduces Trailing Stop Loss and Automatic Take
Profit, which can be activated inside the position dialog.

Furthermore on the download-page there are packages with the
intraday-quotes of the last 7 days for some instruments. You can import
these into the manticore-trader in order to trade bigger time frames.
Quotes for different instruments or time frames will be provided on
demand.

For best performance, we changed to the free database system H2 (see
also the Changelog).

Happy trades using Version 0.9.9.

Best regards
Andreas

Hello Andreas,

I am delighted to see, that the automatic take profit made it into the
trader already at this point. I am eager to check it out and test it.

The only problem is, that 0.9.9 wont let me pass the Database connection
settings window. When I hit the login button, nothing happens. I also
changed the driver selection to no effect.

So far, I always simply unpacked the binaries and double clicked on the
manticore-trader.jar. Do I have to recompile it or do something else? I am
using Windows XP SP3. Java is Version 6.20.

Best regards,
Martin

Dear Martin,

this problem is related to the change of the database system.
manticore-trader uses H2 now, which is much (much, much) faster than
HSQLDB. I tested it carefully and was very impressed.

Of course there is now a problem, when you use your saved settings.
Please adjust the database-settings to:

classname = org.h2.JDBCDriver
connectionUrlStr = jdbc:h2:file:${user.home}manticore-trader2

Replace ${user.home} with your home directory or any other directory,
where you like to store the database.

If this is too complicated, please just move the file settings.xml in
your home-directory into settings.xml.bak and start the program then.
It will use the predefined settings, which you can save via the file
menu.

If it still does not work, please send me the output of the shell:
* open a shell (e.g. command.com)
* change to the directory where you have manticore-trader.jar
* run java -jar manticore-trader.jar there
* copy the output of the shell into the e-mail

Thank you and best regards.
Andreas

BTW: I released version 0.9.9.1 yesterday, which fixes a small but nasty
bug. Give it a try please.

Dear Andreas,

my thanks for you quick reply - everything looks to work perfectly now. Next
week I will probably do a couple of trading tests and I am excited to see,
how everything works out.

Another questions though:

1. Are the stop loss and take profit thresholds calculated and initiated
from the underlying or from the Zertifikat itself? Because if its the
Zertifikat itself, one has to take the spread into consideration, which, at
leverage 10 for example, makes up for 0,16% already. Imagine, you have a
stop loss of 0,2% in place, then the spread alone already takes up most of
it. Or is the underlying the measurement?

2. In what running state does the program need to be kept in order to able
to stop losses and take profits automatically? Does the order form need to
be kept open? Does the program automatically reconnect and takes up work
again, when internet connection is lost temporarily?

3. When the automatic take profit option is activated and the take profit
threshold is actually reached, but the selling order does not go through -
does the program automatically reinstate the stop loss order again after a
while?

Thanks so much for this awesome program!
Martin

Martin, 

you are more than welcome!
I updated the documentation
http://www.manticore-projects.com/content/de/documentation.htm in order
to reflect the new features. Will translate it into English as soon as
possible.

At the moment the mechanism is simple: the threshold is related to the
highest price of the warrant since the position was opened. On Thursday
I recognized already this might not be accurate as it ignores the
leverage of the warrant. I think we have to multiply the trailing stop
loss ratio with the leverage of the warrant. In any way the spread is
recognized already.

In general I feel the solution of using threshold is just a temporary
quick fix.I would like to prefer a solution when the last resistance of
the underyling is used to adjust the stop-loss. But this gives a messy
dependency to the chart module which I would like to avoid.

The auto TP and the trailing stop loss is just a kind of emulation. The
program receive new quotes and adjusts the existing orders accordingly.
This means, the manticore-trader needs to run in order to adjust the
orders. The execution of the order is independent from the
manticore-trader.

In case the connection gets lost, it really depends on the
circumstances. Most times everything continues after short breakage.
Sometimes the push quote stream hangs. Then you need to push the refresh
button.
In the worst case just restart the program. The open positions are
stored and will be updated as soon as you start the manticore-trader.

Please note: you stop-loss is always safe, as its execution does not
depend on manticore-trader. So the worst case is the stop loss is not
adjusted while your position is in the profit already and finally the
original stop loss is executed when the price goes down.

I often go for a walk outside with open positions and I often have power
line or internet breakage -- so I programmed everything as safe as
possible. In fact, auto take profit does not issue a sale-order, but
adjust the existing SL-order to the target. Either the broker accepts
the order or the original SL-order still exists otherwise. This way your
position is never in a state of not being secured by a SL.

Also you can push "set SL to entry" twice: the first time (when SL is
less than entry) SL is adjusted onto entry, the second time (when SL >=
entry) SL is set to last market price. This way you can limit the risk
to the original target but still maintain a small chance of even more
profit.

With your kind feedback we can improve it even more. Please do not
hesitate to contact me in case of any issue! Best regards
